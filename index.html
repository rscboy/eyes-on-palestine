                        <p class="text-gray-400">Echoes of Gaza is a digital historical archive dedicated to documenting
                            the ongoing occupation, displacement, and genocide of the Palestinian people. It serves as a
                            meticulously curated and publicly accessible repository of verified articles, reports, and
                            media evidence, built to resist erasure and preserve truth.</p>

                        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why was this project created?</h4>
                        <p class="text-gray-400">Echoes of Gaza was born from the recognition that history is too often
                            written by those in power, erasing the voices and suffering of the oppressed. The project
                            exists to create a permanent record of events in Gaza and across Palestine, one that cannot
                            be rewritten or denied.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-400">The archive exists to preserve evidence, promote accountability, and
                            humanize the Palestinian struggle. It provides researchers, journalists, and the public with
                            verifiable documentation that exposes patterns of occupation, displacement, and systemic
                            injustice.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-400">The archive is updated daily. Each entry is carefully verified and
                            cataloged with details such as title, author, publication date, and source. The aim is to
                            ensure accuracy, transparency, and reliability for those using the collection for research,
                            reporting, or advocacy.</p>

                        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">How does Echoes of Gaza promote accountability?</h4>
                        <p class="text-gray-400">By creating a centralized and timestamped record of events, the
                            archive makes it impossible for atrocities to be hidden or denied. It provides an
                            evidentiary foundation for journalists, human rights investigators, and legal experts
                            seeking to document war crimes and systemic abuse.</p>
                        <p class="text-gray-400 mt-2">Accountability begins with preservation—once truth is recorded, it
                            cannot be erased.</p>

                            racism?</h4>
                        <p class="text-gray-400">Echoes of Gaza reveals how racism, dehumanization, and colonial bias
                            shape global responses to Palestinian suffering. By placing daily atrocities alongside
                            decades of political betrayal, media distortion, and ignored international law, the archive
                            shows that what is happening in Gaza is not an isolated tragedy, but the result of a
                            broader system of racialized injustice.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-400">It is intended for journalists, educators, researchers, students, and
                            advocates seeking an accurate and human-centered account of what is happening in Gaza. Above
                            all, it is for anyone committed to truth, justice, and memory.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-400">Because silence and distortion are weapons. When records disappear,
                            justice becomes impossible. By preserving evidence and testimony in real time, Echoes of
                            Gaza ensures that the historical record remains intact, and that the truth endures long
                            after headlines fade.</p>
